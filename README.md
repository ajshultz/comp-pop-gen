Code for analysis of public population genomic data from lots of species. This project has several components:

1. fastq_to_vcf: FASTQ to VCF pipeline for reanalysis of SRA datasets

2. vcf_qc: scripts and code to do quality checks on vcf output and appropriately filter results

3. mk_tables: scripts and code to produce MK tables from filtered vcfs
