To think about:
- update paths for required software to more general locations (aspc)
- have to update prefetch config file to alter where SRA data are downloaded to. To do this, go to the bin directory of sra toolkit, and run "./vdb-config -i". Can then navigate down to set default download directory. Currently set to: /n/holylfs/LABS/informatics/ashultz/CompPopGen/raw_sra_files. See here for configuration guide (https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/sra.cgi?view=toolkit_doc&f=std#s-3).

- For now, using simple read group IDs (sample and sra accession as a proxy for lane). Could grab additional info on flowcell etc. from fastq headers, but some variation by technology, so not sure how useful this would be.

- Aaron thought 50 jobs with NCBI downloads was too many, recommended 20, but probably should talk to the folks upstairs.

- Which files to keep and discard (already have it delete mapped sam files). Probably should get rid of raw SRA files too.
